These were my additions/changes to a class assignment where we had to learn to read and review another person's code and possibly make some changes
I chose to change the pictures of the characters and the backdrop in the game to make it Prince themed and change the music.
I also created a new instance in the game , where if the character hits the clock the party(game) is over
